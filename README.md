# Economic-Data-Analysis Data Science

This project applies modern data science techniques to real-world economic indicators using Python. It explores and visualizes international cost of living data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights valuable for students, researchers, and decision-makers.

Key Features:

Imports and analyzes global economic datasets, focusing on key indices such as the Cost of Living Index, Rent Index, and Purchasing Power Index.

Performs comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) with Python libraries including pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly.

Visualizes trends through bar plots, scatter plots, heatmaps, and dynamic maps (Plotly choropleth) for clear geographical and statistical insights.

Identifies trends like the top 10 most/least expensive countries and investigates relationships between living costs and local purchasing power.

Highlights meaningful correlations between economic factors, such as the strong tie between cost of living, groceries, and restaurant prices.

Offers practical conclusions, e.g., high living costs may not always mean low purchasing power, depending on country-specific salary levels.
